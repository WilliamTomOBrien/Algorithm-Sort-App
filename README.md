# Algorithm-Sort-App

The purpose of this application is to visualize the algorithms I am currently learning, while simeltaneously practicing my ability as an android developer.
Eventually, this will be able to visualize several sorting algorithms, and animate them properly.

##  To Do:
Animation Issue (Update on UI Thread)
Add Drop-down menu to UI to incorporate multiple algorithms
